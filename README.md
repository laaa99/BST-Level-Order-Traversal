# BST-Level-Order-Traversal

* MA 2
* CPTS 223

> For this micro assignment, you must implement a binary search tree print function for a level order
printout for the supplied BST class. Included with this file is a BST class that includes everything but
the PrintLevelOrderHelper function implemented. The InOrder, PostOrder, and PreOrder functions are
already done, but the LevelOrder one needs finishing. Note that LevelOrder uses a queue-based
solution instead of the stack based ones weâ€™ve seen before. Your solution MUST use the C++ STL
queue class. The solution is easiest done with a loop instead of recursion.

# Grading
> Your submission will be graded based on the following:

* [7] Your modifications cause no runtime issues and your PrintLevelOrder prints out the given
tree in the proper order level order: 4 2 6 1 3 5 7 9 8
* [3] Your modifications contain good style. For example,
* You provide meaningful variable names
* You provide sufficient and meaningful comments
* Your code is well structured
